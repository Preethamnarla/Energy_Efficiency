# Energy Efficiency
This project is a Wireless Network Simulator that tries to make cellular networks (like 4G/5G) more energy-efficient. Normally, cellular base stations (the towers that send/receive signals) stay on all the time — even when traffic is low (like at night). That wastes a lot of power ⚡.
